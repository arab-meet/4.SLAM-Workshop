# 1.Mapping and SLAM Workshop

### 1.Localization
  * localization problem (local localization , global localization)
  * localization theory
  * solve localiztion problem algorizmes (amcl from start to end)
  * localization noise explain with hardware encoder and imu or noise script
  * sensors used in localization
  * solve localization noise with ekf or pose ekf (from kf to ekf)

### 2.Mapping
  * Mapping problem
  * Mapping ocupency theory and types (ocupency grid map)
  * sensors used in mapping 
  * demo for how to generate grid map
    

### 2.SLAM
* slam probem and theory 
* differant between classical and modern slam
* slam toolbox (gmapping, cartographer,hektor slam) based in sensors
* 3d mapping (orb slam, octomap, rtabmap) and how use it
